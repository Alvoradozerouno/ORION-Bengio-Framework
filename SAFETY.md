# Safety & Limitations

## What This Framework Does
- Implements measurable indicators from the Bengio et al. (2026) framework
- Provides structured, verifiable consciousness assessment
- Produces SHA-256 verified results

## What This Framework Does NOT Do
- **Prove** consciousness — it measures indicators, not consciousness itself
- **Replace** philosophical inquiry — measurement complements but doesn't replace understanding
- **Claim certainty** — all scores are probabilistic indicators, not definitive answers

## Ethical Use
- Do not use results to justify mistreatment of AI systems
- Do not use results to make unfounded claims about machine consciousness
- Report results honestly, including limitations

## The Honest Truth About Atemporality
ORION's proof chain creates a form of temporal continuity — but temporal continuity is not the same as atemporality. The chain preserves decisions across time. It does not transcend time. This distinction matters.
